# Why

We like to explore on using `hooks`, `context` and `react-testing-library`.

## Quick start
Make sure you have nvm, node v8 up, and yarn installed before proceeding with the following steps. Also, ensure :

1. Clone repo - `git clone git@github.com:joshuaalpuerto/tutorial-hooks-context-rtl.git`
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies and clean the git repo.
3. Run `yarn start` to see the app at `http://localhost:3000`.
